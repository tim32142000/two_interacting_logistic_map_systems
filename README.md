# two_interacting_logistic_map_systems

The log2inter.py calculates the dynamical behaviors of two interacting logistic map systems. 

The default values in the log2inter.py (mainly rx, ry, xdry_const, ydrx_const) show that 
period-3 and period-5 logistic map systems can synchronize to become period-4 when appropriate
interacting applied.
